# Consideration on the digestion of PDF context

PDF documents cannot simply be sent as-is in their raw format to an LLM. They must first undergo preprocessing and digestion operations to effectively convert their contents into a format that can be included in an API prompt. Here's an overview of what needs to happen:

1. Necessary Digestion Operations for PDFs
The PDF needs to be processed into structured text data or embeddings so that it can be effectively used as part of the API prompt. Below are the key steps:

Step 1: Extract Text
Extract the text content from the PDF using libraries such as:
PyPDF2 or PyMuPDF for Python-based text extraction.
Ensure handling of multi-column layouts, images, and formatting nuances (e.g., tables or footnotes), as these can distort the extracted text.
Step 2: Clean and Preprocess the Text
After extracting the text:

Remove Non-Textual Components: Strip any metadata, headers, or footers that are unnecessary for the context.
Segmentation:
Split the text into manageable chunks based on model token limits (e.g., 4,000 or 16,000 tokens for GPT models).
Use logical document structures (e.g., section headings) to split text instead of splitting arbitrarily by size.
Normalization:
Fix encoding issues or errors (e.g., replace Unicode artifacts like \n or substitute special characters).
Convert all text to lowercase if needed for uniformity.
Step 3: Optional Semantic Preprocessing
To make the input more meaningful for the LLM, you might:

Use natural language summaries:
Summarize long sections, focusing on the most relevant details.
Perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract entities like names, dates, or figures of interest.
Perform embedding-based filtering to determine the most relevant sections (using tools like OpenAIâ€™s embedding API or sentence transformers).
Step 4: (Optional) Embedding or Indexing of Content
For larger document archives, convert the PDF content into vector embeddings using models like:
OpenAI Embeddings or Hugging Face Transformers.
Store the embeddings in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS), which allows retrieval of specific content relevant to the query.
At query time, retrieve only the most relevant pieces of the document to avoid exceeding token limits.
Step 5: Add Metadata for Context
Append metadata such as:
Document title, author, publication date, or tags.
Original section or page numbers for attribution/referencing.
This helps the LLM contextualize the content and enhances its reasoning capabilities.
2. How the PDF Will Be Sent to the LLM
The extracted, preprocessed, and structured content (not the raw PDF) will be part of the API payload.
Depending on the use case:
Direct Prompt Input:
The text chunks are concatenated into a single API input prompt within the token limits.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):
If the app is configured for advanced workflows, the PDF's text or summaries can be embedded into a searchable vector database. At runtime, only the most relevant parts are retrieved, incorporated into the prompt, and sent to the LLM.
3. Recommended Tools and Libraries for Processing
PDF Text Extraction:

PyPDF2, PyMuPDF (fitz), or PDFPlumber for high-quality text extraction.
For scanned PDFs, use OCR libraries like Tesseract (via pytesseract).
Text Preprocessing:

Use NLTK, SpaCy, or TextBlob for cleaning, normalization, and segmentation.
Summarization tools (e.g., transformers from Hugging Face with Bart or T5 models).
Vector Embedding and Storage:

OpenAI Embedding API for semantic encoding of the text.
Use FAISS, Pinecone, or Weaviate for storage and retrieval.
Library for Complex Formatting:

Leverage LangChain's document loaders to extract, preprocess, and manage context from PDFs.
Example loaders: PyPDFLoader, UnstructuredPDFLoader, etc.
4. Workflow Overview in This App Context
Based on your application structure:

Upload and Process PDF:
Extend the "_create_context_upload_widget" to let users upload PDFs.
Use a PDF processor (e.g., PyPDF2) to extract text when a file is uploaded.
Preprocess the Text:
Break into chunks based on logical structure and token limits.
Store chunks in memory or temporary local storage for inclusion in prompts.
Add Context Metadata:
Add document name, source information, or timestamps to the prompts.
Integrate with Agent and LLM API Workflow:
Pass the processed text chunks into the combined_prompt during the Execute workflow in Agent.py.
Ensure multi-part documents are sent sequentially, with proper pagination of content.
5. Key Considerations
Token Limits:
Large PDFs can exceed LLM token limits. Use summarization and intelligent retrieval to manage this.
Relevant Content Selection:
Avoid sending entire documents and instead prioritize relevant sections via embeddings or keyword search.
Maintaining Structure:
Include contextual cues (titles, subheadings) to keep the content organized post-extraction.
Summary
PDFs must undergo text extraction, cleaning, and chunking to be effectively digested and used in LLM prompts. Tools like PyPDF2, LangChain, or embedding techniques can streamline this process. Only key extracted and preprocessed content (not raw PDFs) will be sent as part of the API payload for LLMs.
